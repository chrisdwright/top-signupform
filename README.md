# TOP - Project: Sign-up Form

A project to practice/showcase some intermediate level HTML and CSS skills from The Odin Project.

## Notes

Flexbox responded in ways that seemed unintuitive. Worth looking deeper into flexbox and how it all runs under the hood. I had issues with :focus and :invalid not acting like they should. The issue was never resolved.

## How to Install/Run

Clone repository and run index.html in your browser.
